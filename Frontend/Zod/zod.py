            Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. "Schema" broadly refers to any data type, from a simple string to a complex nested object.
            Zod is designed to be as developer-friendly as possible. The goal is to eliminate duplicative type declarations. With Zod, you declare a validator once and Zod will 
            automatically infer the static TypeScript type. It's easy to compose simpler types into complex data structures.
