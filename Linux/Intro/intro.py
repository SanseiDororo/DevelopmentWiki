            Linux is a free and open-source operating system kernel first released by Linus Torvalds
            in 1991. It forms the core of various distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian,
            which are used in many different environments from desktop computers to servers, and 
            even embedded devices. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Linux is known for its 
            stability, security, and flexibility, making it popular for both personal and 
            professional use. Users can modify and distribute their version of the software, 
            which has encouraged a vibrant community of developers and users who contribute 
            to its continuous development and improvement.
